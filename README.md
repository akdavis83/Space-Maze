# Space Maze

A WebGL maze game built with Three.js and Box2dWeb. Play it here: https://akdavis83.github.io/Space-Maze/

Level 0- unlimited playground level, very limited puzzle, do not level up from this level, it will generate boundaryless levels moving forward
Level 1- main start level
Level 45- starting from this level will increase the difficulty for the next levels versus starting from level 1
Level 50- anything above this level is massive
Level 145- massively impossible, will hit a few dead ends, ball is heavier and slower due to increased processing time
Level 150-152~ impossibly massive
Level 153~ is possible but my computer quit working, took too long to load up??
